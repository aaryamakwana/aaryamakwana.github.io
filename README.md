## About me:

I am a graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University, and I am highly passionate about Artificial Intelligence systems and its growing importance in solving real-world problems.  

I completed my Bachelors's in Electronics Engineering with a major in Economics from BITS Pilani - one of the 20 top institutes of eminence in India. I completed my bachelor's thesis at [Computer Vision Center, Barcelona](http://www.cvc.uab.es) under the guidance of [Dr. Luis Herranz](https://lherranz.org) on the topic "Hybrid-shot learning using multi-modal data."

I have also worked at Multinational firms like Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo in Fintech/Quant roles wherein I utilised my finance knowledge and explored my interest in Machine learning altogether. 
During my bachelor's, I also completed an internship in breathing analytics at [MIND Lab](https://mindlab.cs.umd.edu) under the guidance of [Dr. Ashok Agrwala](https://www.cs.umd.edu/people/agrawala) which gave me a lot of insight into real-world applications of data analytics and machine learning.

More about me:
Being an extrovert I make friends very easily. I have always loved sports, especially team sports. From being a state-level swimmer in school to being the football captain of my university, sports is my go-to stress reliever.
Travelling is one of my other passions and I have travelled around 8 countries across 4 continents so far!
