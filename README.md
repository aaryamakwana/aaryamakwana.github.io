# Aarya Makwana

I am a final year student at BITS Pilani pursuing B.E. Electronics and Instrumentation along with MSc. Economics. I am highly passionate about AI systems and its growing importance in problem solving.
I am currently pursuing my Bachelor's thesis at Computer Vision Center, Barcelona under the guidance of Dr. Luis Herranz on the topic "Zero-shot learning on multi-modal data."

More about me!

Being an extrovert I make friends very easily. I have always loved sports, especially team sports. From being a state level swimmer in school to being the football captain of my university, sports is my go-to stress reliever.
