# Aarya Makwana

I am a final year student at BITS Pilani pursuing B.E. Electronics and Instrumentation along with MSc. Economics. I am highly passionate about Artificial Intelligence systems and its growing importance in solving real-world problems. 

I am currently working as an intern at Goldman Sachs. I recently completed my Bachelor's thesis at [Computer Vision Center, Barcelona](http://www.cvc.uab.es) under the guidance of [Dr. Luis Herranz](https://lherranz.org) on the topic "Hybrid-shot learning using multi-modal data." I also completed an internship in breathing analystics recently at [MIND Lab](https://mindlab.cs.umd.edu) under the guidance of [Dr. Ashok Agrwala](https://www.cs.umd.edu/people/agrawala) which gave me a lot of insight on real world applications of data analytics and machine learning.

More about me:
Being an extrovert I make friends very easily. I have always loved sports, especially team sports. From being a state level swimmer in school to being the football captain of my university, sports is my go-to stress reliever.
