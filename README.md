## About me:

I am a graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University, deeply passionate about Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, and their transformative power in solving complex real-world problems. My academic journey and professional experiences have equipped me with a strong foundation in machine learning, data analytics, and AI systems, driving my commitment to innovation and impact in these fields.  

I completed my Bachelors's in Electronics Engineering with a major in Economics from BITS Pilani - one of the 20 top institutes of eminence in India. I completed my bachelor's thesis at [Computer Vision Center, Barcelona](http://www.cvc.uab.es) under the guidance of [Dr. Luis Herranz](https://lherranz.org) on the topic "Hybrid-shot learning using multi-modal data."

Professionally, I have had the opportunity to work at leading multinational firms like TikTok, Goldman Sachs, and Wells Fargo. At TikTok, as a Machine Learning Engineer Intern, I optimized search algorithms and enhanced recommendation systems, leading to significant improvements in user engagement and conversion rates. My role at TikTok allowed me to apply cutting-edge machine learning techniques in a fast-paced, data-driven environment, furthering my expertise in AI applications.

In my fintech and quantitative roles at Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo, I combined my finance knowledge with my passion for machine learning. I developed and implemented data-driven models that improved decision-making processes, demonstrating the impact of AI and data science in the financial sector. These experiences have provided me with a unique blend of skills that bridge the gap between technical expertise and business strategy.

During my bachelor's, I also completed an internship in breathing analytics at [MIND Lab](https://mindlab.cs.umd.edu) under the guidance of [Dr. Ashok Agrwala](https://www.cs.umd.edu/people/agrawala) which gave me a lot of insight into real-world applications of data analytics and machine learning.

More about me:
Being an extrovert I make friends very easily. I have always loved sports, especially team sports. From being a state-level swimmer in school to being the football captain of my university, sports is my go-to stress reliever.
Travelling is one of my other passions and I have travelled around 8 countries across 4 continents so far!
